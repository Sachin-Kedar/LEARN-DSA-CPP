#include <iostream> // include is a preprocessor directive.
// iostream file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions.
using namespace std;
int a = 3, b = 5;
//  A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task.
//  The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program, no matter where the function is located in the program.
int main()
{
    // cout << "Namaste Duia --)" << endl;
    // cout << a + b;

    Rules For Declaring Variable
    The name of the variable contains letters, digits, and underscores.
    The name of the variable is case sensitive (ex Arr and arr both are different variables).
    The name of the variable does not contain any whitespace and special characters (ex #,$,%,*, etc).
    All the variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_).
    We cannot used C++ keyword(ex float,double,class)as a variable name.

    There are mainly two types of variable scopes:

    1. Local Variables --Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.
                            Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions.
    2. Global Variables


                ----  Data Types

    Data Types in C++ are Mainly Divided into 3 Types:
    1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
    Integer                      ---- 4
    Character                    ---- 1
    Boolean                      ----
    Floating Point               ---- 4
    Double Floating Point        ---- 8
    Valueless or Void            ----
    Wide Character               ----


    2. Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
    Function
    Array
    Pointer
    Reference


    3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
    Class
    Structure
    Union
    Enumeration
    Typedef defined Datatype
    
    // -- Constants in CPP
    //     syntax-- const data_type var_name = value; */
